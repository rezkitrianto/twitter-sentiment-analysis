Feature Extraction.

Input : resultText.txt -> processed tweets from sanders database
Output : all divided files in folder /dataExtracted -> the file in libsvm and weka format that has been divided into training and testing part

1. The FeatureExtraction is use to extract feature from the tweet, 
this will be resulted as the splitted file in format libSVM and Weka.
Run the file in /dist directory :
java -jar /dist/FeatureExtraction.jar

The result will be splitted into 
a. dataExtracted/forLibSVM that will be used for the LibSVM library for test in the MSVM classifier
b. dataExtracted/forCoTraining that will be used for the baseline that use the Co-Training algorithm with SMO as the classifier
c. dataExtracted/oneTopic for experiment using oneTopic in the division of data training:testing = 70:30


For the libSVM, Copy the data training and testing to your own directory, and run the libSVM library to predict the class and accuracy.
	Use this parameter that has been tuned in libSVM for this data:
	c = 2.0
	g = 0.03125

For the Co-train, Copy the training data into folder data/train and rename it to output_5_1_t.arff
For the testing data, copy the testing data into folder data/test/day1 and rename it to output_5_1_t.arff and output_5_00.arff
